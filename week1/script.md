# setting up your text editor

## recommended editors
 - VS Code
 - VS Code (seriously, I want you to use VS Code)
 - Sublime Text
 - Atom

 <small>Note: I can't help you as well with anything other than VS Code b/c that is what I'm most familiar with. </small>

### Some assumptions

- You're using a mac
- You haven't used the terminal very much
- You have the permissions to install software on your machine

<small> I'm trying out a PC this year so things might look a little different</small>

## Setting up Node

- NPM - Node Package Manager
- Few different ways
- If you're
    - planning on doing a lot of JavaScript development, use NVM
    - only doing this to complete the class (no shame; this is how I took statistics), use the Node installer
- What is NVM? Node Version Manager (you can have multiple versions of node on your machine at once!)
- Node install is usually the latest version.

## What's next? Lint!

- Git (comes with Mac)
    - `git init`
- ESLint (depends on Node)
    - `npm init
 @eslint/config`
 - VS Code ESLint extension
    - from Microsoft
