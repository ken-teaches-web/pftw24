// new subject: React

// how is this going to be different?
// we'll be using a React "seed" generator
// we'll be combining files and libraries with "import"
// vite is a multipurpose utility library that will enable us to do stuff
// vite will combine js, jsx and imports down to "bundles"
// vite can run a developer-friendly server (similar to go live)
// vite can build a "deployable" version of our app with "npm run build"
// vite uses a config file to determine important details for compiling
// as an example , server property
